    <h2>History of C++</h2>
    <p>
        <i>C++ was originally invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1980 at AT & T Bell Labs. 
        It was initially called C with Classes. The name C++ was suggested by Rick Mascitti, 
        and it was first used in December 1983. Name C was not preferred because it would have 
        been a syntax error in C; and it is also the name of an irrelevant language. On the 
        other hand, the expression C++ means C-C+1; hence the name is C++.</i>
